Hi I made this project by using HTML5 and CSS3.
The instructor during the session was Mr.Harry. I got to
learn a lot during entire video session and it was an amazing experience learning with CodeWithHarry.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the video as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<br>In this video everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
